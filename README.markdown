# pickled-vim

These are the vim configurations I'm using. I'll try to comment as much as I can about what's going on, but your mileage may vary.


## Using

Assuming you don't have an existing .vimrc and .vim...

    cd ~
    ln -s /path/to/pickled-vim/vimrc .vimrc
    ln -s /path/to/pickled-vim/vim .vim
